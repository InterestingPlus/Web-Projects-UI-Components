        <h1>About The Roman Colosseum</h1>
        <p>
          The Colosseum (/ˌkɒləˈsiːəm/ KOL-ə-SEE-əm; Italian: Colosseo
          [kolosˈsɛːo]) is an elliptical amphitheatre in the centre of the city
          of Rome, Italy, just east of the Roman Forum. It is the largest
          ancient amphitheatre ever built, and is still the largest standing
          amphitheatre in the world, despite its age. Construction began under
          the emperor Vespasian (r. 69–79 AD) in 72[1] and was completed in AD
          80 under his successor and heir, Titus (r. 79–81).[2] Further
          modifications were made during the reign of Domitian (r. 81–96).[3]
          The three emperors who were patrons of the work are known as the
          Flavian dynasty, and the amphitheatre was named the Flavian
          Amphitheatre (Latin: Amphitheatrum Flavium; Italian: Anfiteatro Flavio
          [aɱfiteˈaːtro ˈflaːvjo]) by later classicists and archaeologists for
          its association with their family name (Flavius).
        </p>
        <p>
          The Colosseum is built of travertine limestone, tuff (volcanic rock),
          and brick-faced concrete. It could hold an estimated 50,000 to 80,000
          spectators at various points in its history,[4][5] having an average
          audience of some 65,000;[6] it was used for gladiatorial contests and
          public spectacles including animal hunts, executions, re-enactments of
          famous battles, and dramas based on Roman mythology, and briefly mock
          sea battles. The building ceased to be used for entertainment in the
          early medieval era. It was later reused for such purposes as housing,
          workshops, quarters for a religious order, a fortress, a quarry, and a
          Christian shrine.
        </p>
        <p>
          Although substantially ruined by earthquakes and stone robbers taking
          spolia, the Colosseum is still a renowned symbol of Imperial Rome and
          was listed as one of the New 7 Wonders of the World.[7] It is one of
          Rome's most popular tourist attractions and has links to the Catholic
          Church, as each Good Friday the Pope leads a torchlit "Way of the
          Cross" procession that starts in the area around the Colosseum.[8] The
          Colosseum is depicted on the Italian version of the 5 euro cent coin.
        </p>

        <h2>Name</h2>
        <p>
          Originally, the building's Latin name was simply amphitheatrum,
          'amphitheatre'.[9] Though the modern name Flavian Amphitheatre (Latin:
          Amphitheatrum Flavium) is often used, there is no evidence it was used
          in classical antiquity.[9] This name refers to the patronage of the
          Flavian dynasty, during whose reigns the building was constructed, but
          the structure is better known as the Colosseum.[9] In antiquity,
          Romans may have referred to the Colosseum by the unofficial name
          Amphitheatrum Caesareum (with Caesareum an adjective pertaining to the
          title Caesar), but this name may have been strictly poetic[10][11] as
          it was not exclusive to the Colosseum; Vespasian and Titus, builders
          of the Colosseum, also constructed a Flavian Amphitheatre in Puteoli
          (modern Pozzuoli).
        </p>
        <h2>Related to the Colossus of Nero statue</h2>
        <p>
          After Nero's suicide and the civil wars of the Year of the Four
          Emperors, the Colossus of Nero statue was remodeled by the condemned
          emperor's successors into the likeness of Helios (Sol) or Apollo, the
          sun god, by adding the appropriate solar crown. It was then commonly
          referred to as the "Colossus solis".[15] Nero's head was also replaced
          several times with the heads of succeeding emperors.[16] Despite its
          pagan links, the statue remained standing well into the Middle Ages
          and was credited with magical powers. The emperor Constantine the
          Great remodeled the statue's face as his own.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the 8th century, an epigram attributed to the Venerable Bede
          celebrated the symbolic significance of the statue in a prophecy that
          is variously quoted: Quamdiu stat Colisæus, stat et Roma; quando cadet
          colisæus, cadet et Roma; quando cadet Roma, cadet et mundus ("as long
          as the Colossus stands, so shall Rome; when the Colossus falls, Rome
          shall fall; when Rome falls, so falls the world").[18] This is often
          mistranslated to refer to the Colosseum rather than the Colossus (as
          in, for instance, Byron's poem Childe Harold's Pilgrimage). However,
          at the time that the Pseudo-Bede wrote, the masculine noun coliseus
          was applied to the statue rather than to the amphitheatre.
