        <h1>About The Petra</h1>
        <p>
          Petra, originally known to its inhabitants as Raqmu or Raqēmō, is a
          historic and archaeological city in southern Jordan. Famous for its
          rock-cut architecture and water conduit system, Petra is also called
          the "Rose City" because of the colour of the sandstone[5] from which
          it is carved;[6] it was famously called "a rose-red city half as old
          as time" in a poem of 1845 by John Burgon. It is adjacent to the
          mountain of Jabal Al-Madbah, in a basin surrounded by mountains
          forming the eastern flank of the Arabah valley running from the Dead
          Sea to the Gulf of Aqaba.[7] Access to the city is through a famously
          picturesque 1.2-kilometre-long (3⁄4 mi) gorge called the Siq, which
          leads directly to the Khazneh.
        </p>
        <p>
          The area around Petra has been inhabited from as early as 7000 BC, and
          the Nabataeans might have settled in what would become the capital
          city of their kingdom as early as the 4th century BC. Archaeological
          work has only discovered evidence of Nabataean presence dating back to
          the second century BC, by which time Petra had become their capital.
          The Nabataeans were nomadic Arabs who invested in Petra's proximity to
          the incense trade routes by establishing it as a major regional
          trading hub.
        </p>
        <p>
          The trading business gained the Nabataeans considerable revenue and
          Petra became the focus of their wealth. Unlike their enemies, the
          Nabataeans were accustomed to living in the barren deserts and were
          able to repel attacks by taking advantage of the area's mountainous
          terrain. They were particularly skillful in harvesting rainwater,
          agriculture, and stone carving. Petra flourished in the 1st century
          AD, when its Al-Khazneh structure, possibly the mausoleum of Nabataean
          king Aretas IV, was constructed, and its population peaked at an
          estimated 20,000 inhabitants.[12] They developed a complex system of
          cisterns, channels, and dams to collect and store rainwater, allowing
          them to thrive in the arid desert environment. Most of the famous
          rock-cut buildings, which are mainly tombs, date from this and the
          following period. Much less remains of the free-standing buildings of
          the city.
        </p>

        <h2>Neolithic</h2>
        <p>
          By 7000 BC, some of the earliest recorded farmers had settled in
          Beidha, a Pre-Pottery Neolithic settlement just north of Petra.
        </p>

        <h2>Bronze Age</h2>
        <p>
          Petra is listed in Egyptian campaign accounts and the Amarna letters
          as Pel, Sela, or Seir.
        </p>
        <h2>Iron Age Edom</h2>
        <p>
          The Iron Age lasted between 1200 and 600 BC; in that time, the Petra
          area was occupied by the Edomites. The configuration of mountains in
          Petra allowed for a reservoir of water for the Edomites. This made
          Petra a stopping ground for merchants, making it an outstanding area
          for trade. Things that were traded here included wines, olive oil, and
          wood.
        </p>
        <p>
          Initially, the Edomites were accompanied by Nomads who eventually
          left, but the Edomites stayed and made their mark on Petra before the
          emergence of the Nabataens. It is said that 10,000 men were thrown off
          of the mountain Umm el-Biyara, but this story has been debated by
          scholars.
